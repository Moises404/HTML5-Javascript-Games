// Define Actor constructor

/* 
Create an Actor class which contains properties and methods
for both the hero and the bad guys. The hero and the bad guys
will be instances of the Actor class. The Actor class will be
responsible for directing the actors with methods such as
moveRight() and moveLeft(), and is also responsible for 
rendering the actors by animating them with sprite sheets.
